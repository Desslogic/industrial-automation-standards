# Industrial Automation Standards

A comprehensive framework for industrial automation development, emphasizing consistency, maintainability, and scalability.

## Core Principles

The standards in this repository follow key principles:
- **Simplicity** - Clean, straightforward implementations over complexity
- **Organization** - Structured approach to all aspects of automation
- **Layering** - Clear separation between components, functions, and systems
- **Inheritance** - Building on established patterns rather than reinventing
- **Documentation** - Complete documentation of all systems and components

## Repository Structure

- `/plc-programming` - Standards for PLC development
- `/ignition` - Ignition SCADA project organization and best practices
- `/network` - Industrial network design and segmentation
- `/mes` - Manufacturing Execution System integration patterns
- `/templates` - Reusable templates for new projects and components

## Implementations

These standards are implemented across multiple projects:
- [ignition-component-library] - Reusable Ignition components
- [plc-udt-libraries] - Standardized User-Defined Types for PLCs
- [portfolio-dashboard] - Showcase of implementations
